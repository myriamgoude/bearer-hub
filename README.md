# Bearer Hub

## Getting Started

```
$ yarn install && yarn start
```

With `yarn start` running, the local site is available at http://localhost:8000/

GraphiQL, the in-browser GraphQL interface, is available at http://localhost:8000/___graphql 

To create a production build, use `yarn build`. 

_**Note without the `ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY` set in your `.envrc` file, `yarn build` will fail to build the Algolia index (`AlgoliaSearchError: Invalid Application-ID or API key`) but otherwise succeed.**_

### Using direnv

We use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage environment variables.

1. Install [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv#install).
2. Add the appropriate line to your `~/.bash` or `~/.zshrc` file:
    ```
      eval "$(direnv hook bash)"
    ```
    or
    ```
      eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
    ```
3. Copy the `.envrc.example` file and rename your copy to `.envrc`. Remember never to commit this `.envrc` file to GitHub!
4. Ask for the necessary secrets from the `.envrc.example` file, such as `ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY` if you need to be able to re-index Algolia's search, to be sent to you securely and add these to your local `.envrc` file. 

### Troubleshooting

Something not working? Here are some steps to try 

1. Delete your local `.cache/`, `.node_modules/`, and `.public/` directories to "turn it off and on again"
2. If you're seeing an error running `yarn start`, try `yarn build` in case a different -- and hopefully more helpful -- error is thrown :)
