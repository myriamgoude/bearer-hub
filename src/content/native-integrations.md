## Bearer Manifesto

Building and Maintaining Integration is too painful. It’s time for drastic changes!

Developers are tired of rebuilding the same Integration, users are frustrated by working with applications that don’t integrate with each other and vendors are clueless on how to find a solution without breaking the bank.

We, as an industry, as developers, and as vendors haven’t been building the right standard to integrate our applications together.
But wait, aren’t there APIs to take care of all of that? In fact yes, many different APIs, as many as there are applications, mostly all working differently! We’ve been focused for too long on the API itself instead of thinking about who, why and how someone will consume it.

A modern application should provide dozens of Integrations, which means understanding dozens of APIs and possible use-cases, and building a lot of vendor-specific code that will have to be maintained.

It’s time to put an end to this nonsense.

Integrations should be **standardized** but not generic. Every application has its specificities and therefore every Integration should be able to reflect this diversity.

As a final result, Integrations should provide a **native** experience, from developers to end users.

With Bearer,

Developers are able to focus on what matters most: their business logic, and not vendor-specific code. They don’t have to reinvent the wheel and maintain it.

Vendors can finally provide all the integrations they need at a fraction of what it took them before.

Users are happy.

Bear with us!
